# Ludo Game frame Design

## Overview

- Built this porpular Nigerian game (ludo) while attempting to work my hands out on CSS.
- Because I'm a sole believer of "learn more by practice" ðŸ˜„.
- Had this made with CSS.

### PS: There's no use of CSS flexbox or grid model on this piece of work ðŸ˜Ž.

- I didn't create a mobile display for this Perhaps you can try working that out?.
